A [sandpit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandpit) (Commonwealth countries) or sandbox (US/Canada) is
a low, wide container or shallow depression filled with sand in which children can play.
Many homeowners with children build sandpits in their backyards because, unlike much playground
equipment, they can be easily and cheaply constructed.
