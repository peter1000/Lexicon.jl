In meteorology, a [cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud) is a visible mass of liquid droplets
or frozen crystals made of water or various chemicals suspended in the atmosphere above the surface
of a planetary body. These suspended particles are also known as aerosols and are studied in the
cloud physics branch of meteorology.
